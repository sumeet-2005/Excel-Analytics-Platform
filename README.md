## Usage
- Upload Excel files and visualize data with interactive charts.
- Save and manage custom chart configurations.
- View upload and chart history.
- Manage notifications and user profile.

## API Endpoints
The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for file history, notifications, saved charts, user profiles, and health checks. See the `server/routes/` directory for details.

## Environment Variables
See `.env` for required variables. You will need to provide:

- **Auth0 configuration**: Sign up at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), create an application, and copy your Domain and Client ID into the `.env` file.
- **MongoDB connection string**: Create a cluster at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas), add a database user, and copy your connection string (URI) into the `.env` file.

Do not commit secrets to version control. Refer to `.env.example` or project documentation for variable names and formats.
